### Overview: Calculating Precision and Sensitivity in Evidence Synthesis Reporting

In the context of evidence synthesis, precision and sensitivity (recall) are critical metrics that help assess the quality and effectiveness of the sources used to compile a final synthesis of articles or references. Below is a detailed explanation of how these metrics are calculated using the provided functions, ensuring they are aligned with the standard definitions of precision and sensitivity while being adapted to the specific requirements of evidence synthesis.

### 1. **Precision Calculation**

#### **Definition of Precision**:
- **Precision** is a measure of the accuracy of the inclusion process. It is defined as the proportion of relevant records (true positives) out of the total records identified as relevant (true positives and false positives). In simpler terms, precision tells us how many of the records that a source contributed were actually included in the final synthesis.

#### **Precision Calculation in the Function**:
- The function calculates precision as:

$$
\text{Precision} = \frac{\text{Final Records from Source}}{\text{Distinct Records from Source}}
$$

  - **Final Records from Source** (`final`): The number of records from a specific source that were included in the final synthesis.
  - **Distinct Records from Source** (`Distinct Records`): The total number of unique records (after deduplication) from that source.

- **Interpretation**:
  - This formula calculates the proportion of the distinct records from each source that were deemed relevant and included in the final synthesis. It answers the question: "Of all the records this source contributed, how many were actually useful?"

- **Alignment with Standard Precision**:
  - The calculation aligns with the standard definition of precision, where the true positives are the records included in the final synthesis, and the distinct records represent the total pool of potentially relevant records from each source.

### 2. **Sensitivity (Recall) Calculation**

#### **Definition of Sensitivity (Recall)**:
- **Sensitivity** (also known as recall) measures how well the sources captured all the relevant records. It is defined as the proportion of true positives out of the sum of true positives and false negatives. In the context of evidence synthesis, sensitivity helps us understand how comprehensively a source contributed to the final synthesis.

#### **Sensitivity Calculation in the Function**:
- The function calculates recall as:

$$
\text{Recall} = \frac{\text{Final Records from Source}}{\text{Total Final Records Across All Sources}}
$$

  - **Final Records from Source** (`final`): The number of records from a specific source that were included in the final synthesis.
  - **Total Final Records Across All Sources** (`Total final records`): The total number of records that made it into the final synthesis from all sources combined.

- **Interpretation**:
  - This formula calculates the proportion of the overall final synthesis that was contributed by each source. It answers the question: "How much did this source contribute to the final set of records we deemed relevant?"

- **Alignment with Standard Sensitivity**:
  - The calculation is adapted to the evidence synthesis context, where we consider the final synthesis as the ground truth. The function assumes that any record not captured by a specific source but included in the final synthesis represents a missed opportunity (a false negative) for that source. Therefore, the recall is calculated as the proportion of the final synthesis derived from each source.

### 3. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
- **Zero Screened Records**:
  - The function checks if the `screened` column contains all zeros, which would mean that no records passed the initial screening phase. If so, the column is removed from the output table to avoid confusion. This ensures the focus remains on the most relevant metrics.
  
### Summary:

- **Precision** measures how many of a source’s records were correctly included in the final synthesis out of all distinct records it provided.
- **Sensitivity (Recall)** measures how much a source contributed to the overall final synthesis, reflecting the source’s comprehensiveness.

These metrics are critical for understanding the effectiveness of different sources in an evidence synthesis process. By focusing on the precision and recall, researchers can assess not only the accuracy but also the coverage of their data sources, ensuring a thorough and reliable synthesis.

### Practical Example:

Let’s consider a hypothetical dataset where:

- **Source A** has 100 distinct records, of which 80 are included in the final synthesis.
- **Source B** has 150 distinct records, of which 120 are included in the final synthesis.
- **The total number of final records across all sources is 200.**

For **Source A**:
- **Precision**:

$$
\text{Precision} = \frac{80}{100} = 0.80 \text{ or } 80\%
$$

- **Sensitivity (Recall)**:

$$
\text{Recall} = \frac{80}{200} = 0.40 \text{ or } 40\%
$$

For **Source B**:
- **Precision**:

$$
\text{Precision} = \frac{120}{150} = 0.80 \text{ or } 80\%
$$

- **Sensitivity (Recall)**:

$$
\text{Recall} = \frac{120}{200} = 0.60 \text{ or } 60\%
$$
